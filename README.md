## 🔐 Features

1. **RSA/AES Hybrid Encryption**
   - AES key encrypts user data.
   - RSA (public key) encrypts AES key.
   - RSA (private key) decrypts AES, which then decrypts the data.

2. **Secure Password Management**
   - BCrypt hashing for user passwords.
   - Passwords and RSA private keys stored in a **vault-like**, separate database.

3. **JWT-Based Authentication**
   - JWT tokens used to protect API routes.
   - Verification and RBAC implemented at the API entrypoint.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Admin-only routes and dashboard with restricted functionality.

5. **Spring MVC Architecture**
   - Modular and clean code structure following Java Spring MVC patterns.

6. **Google SMTP Integration**
   - Automated email services and verification via Gmail SMTP.

7. **Cross-User Operations**
   - Includes `SendMoney`, `RequestMoney` functionality beyond standard CRUD.

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- Very basic frontend with limited user interactivity.
- No proper async/delay/loading feedback handling.
- No session refresh or multiple session detection.
- JWT tokens aren't invalidated (no delisting or blacklisting).
- Unverified accounts are not auto-deleted.
- Password reset lacks OTP verification (if email is compromised, so is the account).
